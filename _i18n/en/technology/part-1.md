### Private
{: .subsection-title}
## Zen is a privacy platform built on zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) technology with a decentralized secure node architecture.

### Secure
{: .subsection-title}
## ZenCash is the first cryptocurrency with fully end-to-end encryption at the node and internode level.
In addition to zk-SNARKs, the Zen architecture includes encryption at the node level. Cryptocurrencies rely on nodes to operate, we require our Secure Node operators to have the latest Information Technology and Network Security to qualify for compensation.

### Untraceable
{: .subsection-title}
## Shielded transactions are fully encrypted, yet can be verified as valid under the network's consensus. The sender, recipient, and amount are hidden on the blockchain, making Zen completely untraceable.

Domain fronting is a versatile censorship circumvention technique that hides the remote endpoint of a communication. It works at the application layer, using HTTPS, to communicate with a forbidden host while appearing to communicate with some other host, permitted by the censor.

The key idea is the use of different domain names at different layers of communication. One domain appears on the “outside” of an HTTPS request–in the 9 DNS request and TLS Server Name Indication, while another domain appears on the “inside”–in the HTTP Host header, invisible to the censor under HTTPS encryption. A censor, unable to distinguish fronted and non-fronted traffic to a domain, must choose between allowing circumvention traffic and blocking the domain entirely, which results in expensive collateral damage.

Domain fronting does not require special cooperation by network intermediaries. We identify a number of hard-to-block web services, such as content delivery networks, that support domain-fronted connections and are useful for censorship circumvention.

### Resilient

Zen Secure Nodes enable a distributed and reliable cryptocurrency system that encrypts inter-node communications. Zen node communication looks like any other encrypted internet traffic, instead of like Bitcoin traffic. This effectively hides the type of activity taking place, making it less likely that Zen users and nodes are blocked.
